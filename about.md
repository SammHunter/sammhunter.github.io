### Sam
_Western Tennessee_

_NCSU '22, Masters of Statistics_

_SAS Programming Intern @ a Contract Research Organization_

When I'm not studying, I'm usually trying to teach my dog, [Harlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley), a new trick or taking her to a park. I also have two cats, Boo (tortiose colored) and Dusty. Since we have been stuck at home, I watched every Washington Capitals game last season and currently watch a lot of animal cams like [Monteray Bay Aquarium's live cams](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/live-cams/sea-otter-cam). I also have an obsession with the weather that probably comes from my mom working on geostationary sattelites. I really interested in watching weather manifest on RADAR as well. This time of year is good for keeping an [eye](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/) on tropical storms as they move through and out of the the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean (NOAA please email me back!).
