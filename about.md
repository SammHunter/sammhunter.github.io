### Sam
_Western Tennessee_

_NCSU '22, Masters of Statistics_

_SAS Programming Intern @ a CRO_

I got into statistics in a very round-about way. In 2013, Colorado was hit by a storm that wedged itself against the Rockies and dumped rain, resulting in 500-year flood, which I now know is not a flood that happens every five hundred years. A 500-year flood has a 1 in 500 chance of happening in any given year. My best friend convinced me to take a hydrology class with her and that was pretty much it for me. I loved taking data from USGS collection sites, exploring the data, and drawing conclusions. I ended up changing my major after that semester and graduated with a degree in biology. Now, five years after graduation from CU Boulder, I'm getting a masters in statistics at North Carolina State University and just began an internship with a contract research organization

When I'm not studying, I'm usually trying to teach my dog, [Harlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley), a new trick or taking her to a park. I also have two cats, Boo and Dusty who greatly enjoy supervised outdoor time. I'm not letting any eco-terrorists out on my watch. Since we have been stuck at home, I watched every Washington Capitals game last season and currently watch a lot of animal cams like [Monteray Bay Aquarium's live cams](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/live-cams/sea-otter-cam). I also still have an obsession with the weather. I'm really interested in watching storms manifest on RADAR and hearing about how the jet streams destabilazation and ocean warming is affecting the weather from year-to-year. This time of year is good for keeping an [eye](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/) on tropical storms as they move through and out of the the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.
