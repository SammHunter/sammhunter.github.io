### More Information

I'm a graduate student at NCSU and planning on graduating in Spring '22 and just began a SAS Programmer internship. When I'm not studying, I'm usually trying to teach my dog, [Harlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley), a new trick or taking her to a park. I also have two cats, Boo and Dusty, that my husband spoils rotten. We're currently saving up to screen in our deck just so they can hang out outside safely. The two of us enjoy SCUBA diving when there isn't a pandemic happening. Since we are stuck at home, I caught every Washington Capitals game last season, and I was lucky enough to catch up on the Olympics after my summer finals this year. Right now, I'm keeping an eye on the weather as storms form in the Atlantic.
