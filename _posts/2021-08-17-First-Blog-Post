Data Scientists vs Statisticians - Medium, ODSC Journal, 2019
*"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering
 than any statistician." - Twitter, 2012

*Confluence of three areas: computer science, mathematics/statistics, and specific domain knowledge. 
 Focus is solving specific problems (rather than exploring/taking a deep dive on data). 
 
 *A statistician works with nuances and fairly high-level interpretations, while a data scientist applies those high-level concepts
  to data in a fairly methodical process and can make more digestable conclusions.  This article argues that these two spheres should
  be blended more; they work better together than alone. 
 
 
 
Machine Learning Engineer vs Data Scientist - Andrew Zola, 2019
*Has the QUOTE and picture (Venn Diagram)
*Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence (Automata theory, complex information processing, cybernetics) >
   > Machine Learning:
      - data driven algorithms enables software application to become highly accurate in predicting outcomes without need for explicit programming
      - develop algorithms that can receive input data and leverage statistical models to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available
      
***Data science "described as the description, prediction, and casual inference from both structures and unstructured data"
   - study of where data originates, what it represents, and how it could be transformed into a valuable resource
   - does the statistical analysis required to determine which machine learning approach to use, then they model the algorithm and prototype
   - knows the math part AND the cs part
*WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR:
   - gain a competitive advantage
   - id new market opportunities
   - increase efficiencies
   - reign in costs
   
   ***Reread "What Do the Experts Say?" - Shubhankar Jain's quote is really good
   
   

Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Machine Learning - Expert Talk, Srihari Sasikumar, updates 06/22/21
*Has the picture, combo of hacker man, math/stat know how, and substantive expertise 
*Data science does the data cleansing, prep, & analysis



What is data science vs statistics? - The Signal, Justin Megahan
*Damn, Nate Silver is kind of rude. Also, I don't trust people that are too into 538. 



HOMEWORK: 
What do you think being a data scientist is about?

In Fall 2015, my genomics professor strolled in and announced to our lab section that his wife got a new job with a huge raise, just by changing her job title 
"Big Data Scientist". I also assume she was highly qualified for the position, but I think this is where my confusion about data science comes in. It's now six
years later, and I think I might have figured it out. A data scientist is someone who uses statistics t


What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  



What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?


How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I enjoy the data science work more than I enjoy the pure statistics
